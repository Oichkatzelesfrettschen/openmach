# This makefile is for the i386 microkernel.
# It is usually included by the Makefile
# configured from the Makefile.in file in this same directory,
# but might be included instead from some other place
# if the i386 code is used in an even more specific configuration.

# XXX support simultaneous SMP and non-SMP kernels.

# abs_builddir is /app/i386 when configure is run there.

# OBJDIR should point to where Makeconf is, relative to this Makefile's location if Makeconf is included relatively,
# or an absolute path. @abs_builddir@ is /app/i386.
OBJDIR	= @top_builddir@
